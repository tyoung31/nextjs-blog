**Mt. Leconte** is a grueling but extremely rewarding hike in the Great Smokey Mountain National Park. The trail climes a total 2763ft in elevation at roughly 502ft per mile. Once at the top you'll be treated with panormic views of the park as well as a visit to The Leconte Lodge which is built at the peak of the mountain.
