**Abrahms Falls** is one of my favorite hikes for many reasons. First, its extremely accesible being roughly a 45 minute drive from my home. Secondly, the trail is comparatively short with a moderate elevation gain of only 340ft and can be completed in just a couple hours. Abrahms Falls itself is the largest waterfall by volume in the Great Smokey Mountain National Park.
